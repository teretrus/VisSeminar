The task of automatically processing and classifying digital media is challenging, as in many applications, high-dimensional feature-spaces have to be handled. Feature selection is one method to facilitate this process by reducing the original feature space to a subset of relevant, non-redundant features. The aim of this paper is to give an overview and present the state-of-the-art in the broad field of feature selection methods. The focus lies on filter, wrapper and embedded methods for flat features, and group methods for structured features. All methods do not only apply to digital media, but can also be used with any other form of digital data.
