The task of automatically processing and classifying digital media is challenging, as in many applications, 
high-dimensional feature-spaces have to be handled. Feature selection is one method to facilitate this process
by reducing the original feature space to a subset of relevant, non-redundant features. The aim of this paper is
to give an overview on the broad field of feature selection methods and present the state-of-the-art. 
The focus lies on filter, wrapper and embedded methods for flat features, and group methods for structured features. 
All presented methods can not only be used in conjunction with digital media, but also with other types 
of digital data.
