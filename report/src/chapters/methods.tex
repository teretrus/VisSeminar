Three types of features can be distinguished: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Flat Feature methods
  \item Structured Feature methods
  \item Streaming Feature methods
\end{itemize}

The decision, which method should be taken, is dependent on the nature of the
features. The distinction between Flat Feature methods and Structured Feature
methods is not easy to make. Flat Feature methods take no realtionship of
features into account, whereas Structured Feature methods take a given
relationship and use it to preserve sturctural information.

Since it is not always clear which feature is related to which other feature,
structures are hard to be defined and might also give worse results if assumed
wrong. In general, if the structure tends to represent the correct realtionships
of the given features, Structured Feature methods tend to outperform Flat
Feature methods (\cite{Tang:14}).

While Flat Feature methods and Structured Feature methods assume a given, finite
feature set, Streaming Feature methods work on an infinite or growing feature
set. Streaming Feature methods are a more general approach, and find
applications in social media.
