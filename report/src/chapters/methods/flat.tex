\label{sec:methods.flat}

% Author: Silvana

Flat features are features that are assumed to be independent.
If we look at flat features, three different types for feature
selection methods can be distinguished:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Filter methods
  \item Wrapper methods
  \item Embedded methods
\end{itemize}

In this section, a short introduction on those three categories will be given, 
including a discussion of their benefits and disadvantages.
