\subsubsection{The Grafting Algorithm}
\label{sec:methods.streaming.grafting}

% Author: Flo

This algorithm uses a newly generated feature, and checks wheter to add it or
not. In the same step existing features are evaluated and might be removed.

The Grafting Algorithm extends the lasso method and uses its term to decide
wheter or not to take a feature. If adds a term to set weights to zero if their
mean classification error is too high in relation to the regularization penalty.

This evaluation is done for every feature once a new feature is added.
Features with a zero-value weight are then eliminated
(\cite{perkins2003online}).
