\subsubsection{The Alpha-investing Algorithm}

This algorithm takes a new feature and assigns an initial $\alpha$-value to it.
All $\alpha$-values are stored and represent a feature. Everytime a new feature is
added, a threshold is updated, based on a socalled p-value
(\cite{zhou2005learning}) and based on the $\alpha$-values of all selected
features. Then this threshold is used to select which features stay in the
selected set an which do not.

The basic idea is to have a certain wealth (the threshold) that can be spent on
features. Everytime a new feature is included, wealth needs to be spent, and the
possibility of another feature being unselected is higher. If another feature is
then unselected, the wealth increases and can be spent on new features again.
