Mutual information is a measurement that measures a variables dependency on
another variable. No mutual information means they are independent, high mutual
information means they are dependent on each other.

Some concrete algorithms that are based on this approach are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Min redundancy max relevance
  \item Information gain
\end{itemize}

Min redundancy max relevance combines measures for redundancy and relevance, and
then selects features with high relevance and minimum redundancy.

Information gain measures the amount of information a feature provides when it
comes to class prediction. If a feature has good discriminative properties it is
choosen.
