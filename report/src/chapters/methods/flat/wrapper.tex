In contrast to filter methods, wrapper methods are dependent on the classifier used after the feature selection. 
The feature-set is selected so that it fits the biases and heuristics of the classifier as good as possible. 

This is achieved by sequentially applying two steps: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item A search routine selects a set of features 
  \item The selected subset is evaluated with the desired classifier
\end{itemize}

When choosing a search routine, one should take the structure of the search space into account.
Especially its size plays a crucial role, as it grows exponentially with increasing  the number of features. 
(The more features there are, the more possible subsets can be created.) 
As real-life applications can involve thousands of features, the search can not be done randomly, 
but has to follow a certain strategy. 
Typical algorithms used are hill-climbing, best-first, or greedy-search, to name a few.

When a potential subset is found, its suitability for the desired classifier has to be evaluated. 
This can be done for example by simply using a validation set, or by performing cross-validation.

The search and evaluation steps are repeated until a desired quality of the subset is reached. 
The first step will produce a set of features, which then are used by the classifier. 
The feature set with the best results (e.g. highest estimation values) will
then be used for the actual classification task.


The major drawback of this approach is the computation time needed, as the subsequent search- and evaluation steps are computationally expensive. 
Compared to filter methods, better performance and more accurate estimates are achieved for the chosen classifier.
Also, as the selected subset is dependent on the classifier, it cannot be used with any classifier, as the results will be biased.

This chapter will go more in-depth about different search-techniques, before discussing validation-strategies shortly.
