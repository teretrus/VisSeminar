is a Pruning Method, that uses SVM(Support Vector Machines) to select the most
contributing features.

Since SVM-classifiers are basically a hyperplane that separates data in a
high-dimensional space into positive and negative matches, the classification
can be reduced to a simple inside-outside test with the plane, wich is basically
a dot-product with the corresponding hesse-normal-form of the plane.

This method now eliminates all components of the plane, in which the
hesse-normal-form of the plane is close to $0$, and therefore removing
less- and non-contributing features \cite{Brank:02}.

As SVMs mostly work in a space which has a higher dimensionality than the
original feature-space, the remaining features of the high dimensional space
need to be mapped to features of the low dimensional space to effectively
eliminate features.
