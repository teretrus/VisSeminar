\subsubsection{Filter Methods}

As the name suggests, filter methods try to filter out relevant features from
not-relevant ones. 
This is done by considering only the actual dataset, 
the properties of the classifier which will be used afterwards are ignored.
 
Thus, filter methods are independent of the classification algorithm: Any
classifier can be used on the filtered features, 
which allows to try out different algorithms on the feature set.
 
This can be seen as an advantage, but on the other side, 
complete independency can also have its drawbacks. 
As characteristics of the specific classifiers are not considered, 
it is not clear which classifier works best with the selected subset. 
Thus the selected subset does not guarantee optimal performance of the classifier.
