Embeddd Methods are an approach to combine the computational efficiency of
Filter Methods with the quality of Wrapper Methods.
By addressing the characteristics of the classifier, Embedded Methods select
features that are more suiting for classification than Filter Methods. At the
same time, they are not as computational expensive as Wrapper Methods.
  
Embedded Methods can roughly been characterized into three categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pruning Methods
  \item Built-in Methods
  \item Regression Methods
\end{itemize}
