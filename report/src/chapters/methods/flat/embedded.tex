As both filter and wrapper methods have different strengths and weaknesses, 
it seems only natural that research tried to combine both ideas to create so-called embedded methods, 
which are basically a hybrid of the former two. 
The strategy is to involve the classifier and its properties (like wrapper methods) while selection the features, 
and being computationally efficient at the same time (like filter methods).

Three types:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Linear Classifiers (Pruning methods, SVM, logistic regression)
  \item ID3 / C4.5 with build-in mechanism (WTF?) 
  \item Regularisation models
\end{itemize}

Regularisation models idea: fit the moddel, but try to have as many weightsas
possible small or close to 0, so we can eliminate features with small/zero weights
