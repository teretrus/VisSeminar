\subsection{Methods for Structured Features}

Other than Flat Features, Structured Features are features where a certain
underlying structure is known or assumed and will be used. This approach tends
to outperform Methods for Flat Features in certain cases, for example
genome analysis in bio-informatics (\cite{Tang:14}).

Methods for Structured Features can be categorized into $3$ groups:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Graph Methods
  \item Tree Methods
  \item Group Methods
\end{itemize}

The decision which structure to use, is dependent on the relationship of the
features. Group and tree methods basically assume simple hierarchical groupings
of features, whereas graph methods build a more complex relationship-graph.
