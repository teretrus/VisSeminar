Streaming Feature methods are operating on a growing or infinite feature set. In
some applications - e.g. secial media - new features come up every minute and
can or cannot be taken into account. 
The basic method for streaming features can be described in four steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Step $1$: Generate a new feature
  \item Step $2$: Determining whether to select the new feature
  \item Step $3$: Determining whether to remove an already selected feature
  \item Step $4$: Continue with Step $1$
\end{itemize} 
Modified from \cite{Tang:14}.
 
Some methods that are based on this approach are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Grafting Algorithm (\cite{perkins2003online})
  \item The Alpha-investing Algorithm (\cite{zhou2005learning})
\end{itemize}
