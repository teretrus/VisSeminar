Slide 
Motivation:
Multimedia Data, quantify 
Many features, select relevant ones

Slide
Motivation:
Remove redundancy:
Expressive representation of data
More accurate classification  
Speed up computation time

Slide 
Feature Selection:
No new features
Select relevant subset
Discriminating features

Slide
Feature types:
Flat: Independent
Structured: of certain structure

Slide 
Flat features
Outperformed by structured feature methods
Many features with no relation to each other
select representative subset
No information about structure needed

Slide
Methods  for flat features:
Filter  
Wrapper
Embedded

(evtl 1-2 bsp pro art, fortführendes zeug?) 
 

Slide
Structured features
Outperform flat feature methods
Certain assumption about structure
(Bsp tree-structure - evtl sogar was konkretes, f.ex. alter/jahre/monate ?!)

Slide
Methods for structured:
Group 
Tree
Graph

(evtl 1-2 bsp pro art, fortführendes zeug?) 

Slide 
Applications:
Classification/ pattern recognition
Data representation
Prediction
